# training_tasks
#well, it's a rep for my examples from stepik, yandex.practicum and skillbox courses. 


#07.10.2020 - 08.10.2020 - I commit my old works


#09.10.2020 - I start a new course

#so I created a new branch 'Anphisa' for first part of lessons tasks

#10.10.2020 I push to 'Anphisa' a dict exapmle

#by the way. I write it this not only for I coluld see the little gteen scuares in my profile, this is just second reason
#this file is like a diary and a handbook at the same time. There is less then week I'm here, but I still remember where is what and which file I can look if I'll forget somthing
#but I know that it's not forever, so this file can halp me once upon a future.
