#by the way. I write it this not only for I coluld see the little gteen scuares in my profile, this is just second reason
#this file is like a diary and a handbook at the same time. There is less then week I'm here, but I still remember where is what and which file I can look if I'll forget somthing
#but I know that it's not forever, so this file can halp me once upon a future.

19.01.2021 I love green squares and I don't believe someone's look here, so I'll add new pojects into main branch just because.
25.01.2021 I change my mind. I can't use my rep without any organisation. my newest commit is in 'pandas' branch. I started a new little project with data processing.
