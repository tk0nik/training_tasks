Zuma is a computer game. 
The goal of the game is to destroy all colorful balls moving in a chain across the screen in the direction
Of the Golden Skull before the balls reach it. 

If this happens, then the level is lost. 

The frog allows you to shoot balls of different colors. 
Chains of balls of the same color (three or more balls) explode when hit by a ball of the same color. 
The main task is to knock out all the balls on the level and score as many points as possible.

Let's imagine a simplified version of the game. Let the balls line up. 
As it was said, when a continuous chain of three or more balls of the same color is formed. 
In this case, all the balls move towards each other, and the situation can repeat itself.

Write a program that, for a given situation, determines how many balls will be "blown up". 
It is guaranteed that at the initial moment there can be no more than one continuous chains of three or more same-colored balls.

Input

The first line contains a natural number n - the number of balls in the chain, which does not exceed 1000.

The second line contains numbers from 0 to 9 separated by a space - the colors of the balls. Each color has its own number.


Output

It is required to display the number of balls that will be "blown up".
